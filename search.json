    "section": "",
    "text": "In the 2024, there were six quarterbacks taken in the first 12 picks, which is a record. Each of the first three picks were quarterbacks. The first three were Caleb Williams to the Bears, Jayden Daniels to the Commanders and Drake Maye to the Patriots. The Falcons shocked everybody when they took Michael Penix Jr. at eight overall. JJ McCarthy went to the Vikings 10th overall and Bo Nix was picked by the Broncos at 12th overall.\nAny time a quarterback is taken this high, there are very lofty expectations for them. They are supposed to be the savior of the franchise.\nAt the moment, the common consensus seems to be that Daniels and Nix have performed the best out of all the rookies. Daniels started out in front, but Nix has caught up, and maybe surpassed Daniels, depending on who you ask.\nIn this article, I will try and determine which first round quarterback has been the best so far. I will not include JJ McCarthy, since he is out for the year with an injury. I also will not include Michael Penix Jr., since he is still sitting behind Kirk Cousins. I also won’t include, Drake Maye, because he didn’t start until the sixth game. I will be comparing Caleb Williams, Jayden Daniels and Bo Nix.\nFirst, we will look at total touchdowns from each quarterback as the season progressed. This combines passing, rushing and receiving touchdowns (Yes, Bo Nix had a receiving touchdown.)\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nrookies &lt;- read_csv(\"data/rookies2024.csv\")\n\nstep &lt;- rookies|&gt; \n  mutate(\n    TotalTD = PassTD + RushTD + RecTD ) |&gt; \n  group_by(QB) |&gt;\n  mutate(SeasonTD = cumsum(TotalTD)) |&gt;\n  mutate(SeasonYds = cumsum (PassYds)) |&gt;\n  mutate(SeasonINT = cumsum (Int))\n\nselectTD &lt;- step |&gt;\n  select(TotalTD, SeasonTD, Game)\n\nnixTD &lt;- selectTD |&gt; filter(QB == \"Bo Nix\")\n\ndanielsTD &lt;- selectTD |&gt; filter(QB == \"Jayden Daniels\")\n\nwilliamsTD &lt;- selectTD |&gt; filter(QB == \"Caleb Williams\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_line(\n    data = williamsTD, \n    aes(x = Game, y = SeasonTD, group = QB), \n    color = \"#0B162A\"\n  ) +\n  geom_line(\n    data = nixTD, \n    aes(x = Game, y = SeasonTD, group = QB), \n    color = \"#FB4F14\"\n  ) +\n  geom_line(\n    data = danielsTD, \n    aes(x = Game, y = SeasonTD, group = QB), \n    color = \"#FFB612\"\n  ) + \n  annotate(\n    \"text\", \n    x = 10.5, \n    y = 19, \n    label = \"Bo Nix\"\n  ) +\n  annotate(\n    \"text\", \n    x = 2, \n    y = 5, \n    label = \"Jayden Daniels\"\n  ) +\n  annotate(\n    \"text\", \n    x = 10, \n    y = 8, \n    label = \"Caleb Williams\"\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Game\", \n    y = \"Total Touchdowns\", \n    title = \"Bo Nix races to rookie QB touchdown lead\", \n    subtitle=\"Jayden Daniels started in front, but has been surpassed by Nix\",\n    caption=\"Source: Pro Football Reference | By Josh Rodriguez\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    breaks=c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13), \n    limits=c(0.75, 13.75)\n  )  +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(\n      size = 16, face = \"bold\"\n    ),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, Jayden Daniels started the season with the lead in total touchdowns. He held that lead all the way until game 8. Daniels cooled off a little at this point, but has rebounded and currently sits at 21 total touchdowns\nBo Nix took the lead in total touchdowns after game 8. Nix started off very slowly in this category. It wasn’t until his eight game where he really started to take off in total touchdowns. Since that point, he has been a touchdown machine. He currently leads the rookies with 22 total touchdowns.\nCaleb Williams, on the other hand, has never led in this category. He is currently in a distant third with only 16 total touchdowns. He even had a four game stretch from games seven though 10 where he didn’t have a single touchdown.\nIn this category, Bo Nix has the edge, especially as of late. He leads in total touchdowns, but it is even more impressive if you go back to game eight. In that six game strech, he has 14 total touchdowns.\nNext, we will look at passing yards in each game.\n\n\nCode\nyards &lt;- step |&gt;\n  select(PassYds, Game)\n\nnixYds &lt;- yards |&gt; filter(QB == \"Bo Nix\")\n\ndanielsYds &lt;- yards |&gt; filter(QB == \"Jayden Daniels\")\n\nwilliamsYds &lt;- yards |&gt; filter(QB == \"Caleb Williams\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_line(\n    data = williamsYds, \n    aes(x = Game, y = PassYds, group = QB), \n    color = \"#0B162A\"\n  ) +\n  geom_line(\n    data = nixYds, \n    aes(x = Game, y = PassYds, group = QB), \n    color = \"#FB4F14\"\n  ) +\n  geom_line(\n    data = danielsYds, \n    aes(x = Game, y = PassYds, group = QB), \n    color = \"#FFB612\"\n  ) + \n  annotate(\n    \"text\", \n    x = 4, \n    y = 50, \n    label = \"Bo Nix\"\n  ) +\n  annotate(\n    \"text\", \n    x = 8.25, \n    y = 30, \n    label = \"Jayden Daniels\"\n  ) +\n  annotate(\n    \"text\", \n    x = 9, \n    y = 110, \n    label = \"Caleb Williams\"\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Game\", \n    y = \"Passing Yards\", \n    title = \"Rookie quarterbacks stay close in terms of yards\", \n    subtitle=\"All three have had highs and lows\",\n    caption=\"Source: Pro Football Reference | By Josh Rodriguez\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    breaks=c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13), \n    limits=c(0.75, 13.75)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(\n    breaks=c(50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350)\n  )  +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(\n      size = 16, face = \"bold\"\n    ),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggsave(\"image.png\")\n\n\nIn this chart, you can see that each quarterback has had highs and lows. Caleb Williams is the only one to have multiple 300 yard passing games. However, It seems that he is lower than the others in many weeks.\nBo Nix has had more lows earlier in the season, especially in game four, where he only had 60 yards (The Broncos still won that game.) However, similarly to the touchdown chart, starting in game 8, he has consistently had higher passing yards numbers.\nJayden Daniels has been very consistent. The one valley was a game where he left early with an injury. He has been the most consistent in this category throughout the season, but Nix has been ahead as of late.\nBased on this, I think Daniels has been the best in this category if you look at the whole season. However, Nix has topped Daniels as of late.\nIn order to put this chart together, we will now look at the passing yards per game for each quarterback throughout the entire season.\n\n\nCode\nrookies2 &lt;- read_csv(\"data/rookietotals.csv\")\n\nPassYPG &lt;- rookies2 |&gt;\n  select (Player, YPG)|&gt;\n  arrange(desc(YPG))\n\nrating &lt;- rookies2 |&gt;\n  select (Player, Rate) |&gt;\n  arrange (desc(Rate))\n\nYPA &lt;- rookies2 |&gt;\n  select (Player, YPA) |&gt;\n  arrange (desc(YPA))\n\nPassYPG |&gt;\n  gt() |&gt;\n  cols_label(\n    Player = \"Quarterback\",\n    YPG = \"Pass Yards Per Game\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Rookies airing it out evenly\",\n    subtitle = \"Bo Nix leads the bunch by a slight margin\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Josh Rodriguez  |  **Source:** Pro Football Reference\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n    style = list(\n      cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n      cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size = 12)\n    )\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n    style = list(\n      cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n      cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size = 12)\n    )\n  ) |&gt;\n  opt_row_striping() |&gt;\n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") |&gt;\n  fmt_number(\n    columns = c(YPG),\n    decimals = 1\n  ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRookies airing it out evenly\n\n\nBo Nix leads the bunch by a slight margin\n\n\nQuarterback\nPass Yards Per Game\n\n\n\n\nBo Nix\n218.6\n\n\nJayden Daniels\n216.8\n\n\nCaleb Williams\n211.2\n\n\n\nBy: Josh Rodriguez | Source: Pro Football Reference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, Bo Nix and Jayden Daniels are very close in this category, while Caleb Williams lags behind. Again, the interesting thing about Williams is that he is the only one of the three to have multiple 300 yard passing games with three. This again points to his valleys being much lower than the other two, which can be seen in the previous chart.\nNext, we will look at yards per pass attempt for each quarterback\n\n\nCode\nYPAbar &lt;- rookies2 |&gt;\n  select(Player, YPA)\n\nnixypa &lt;- YPAbar |&gt;\n  filter (Player == \"Bo Nix\")\n\ndanielsypa &lt;- YPAbar |&gt;\n  filter (Player == \"Jayden Daniels\")\n\nwilliamsypa &lt;- YPAbar |&gt;\n  filter (Player == \"Caleb Williams\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=YPAbar, aes(x=reorder(Player, YPA), weight=YPA), fill = \"lightgrey\") + \n  geom_bar(data=nixypa, aes(x=reorder(Player, YPA), weight=YPA), fill = \"#FB4F14\")+      geom_bar(data=danielsypa, aes(x=reorder(Player, YPA), weight=YPA), fill = \"#FFB612\")+\n  geom_bar(data=williamsypa, aes(x=reorder(Player, YPA), weight=YPA), fill = \"#0B162A\")+\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Jayden Daniels is letting it fly\",\n    subtitle = \"Daniels is averaging almost eight yards per attempt\",\n    x = \"\", \n    y = \"Yards per Attempt\"\n  ) +                          \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 14), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 14), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this category, Jayden Daniels leads the bunch, averaging just under eight yards per attempt. Bo Nix is at 6.5 yards per attempt, while Caleb Williams is at 6.3 yards per attempt. In this category, Daniels clearly has the upper hand.\nFinally, we will look at passer rating, which is on a scale from 0 to 158.3. It combines completion percentage, yards per attempt, touchdown percentage and interception percentage.\n\n\nCode\nrating |&gt;\n  gt() |&gt;\n  cols_label(\n    Player = \"Quarterback\",\n    Rate = \"Passer Rating\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Jayden Daniels comfortably leads in passer rating\",\n    subtitle = \"Daniels is over 10 points better thatn Nix and Williams\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Josh Rodriguez  |  **Source:** Pro Football Reference\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n    style = list(\n      cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n      cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size = 12)\n    )\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n    style = list(\n      cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n      cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size = 12)\n    )\n  ) |&gt;\n  opt_row_striping() |&gt;\n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") |&gt;\n  fmt_number(\n    columns = c(Rate),\n    decimals = 1\n  ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJayden Daniels comfortably leads in passer rating\n\n\nDaniels is over 10 points better thatn Nix and Williams\n\n\nQuarterback\nPasser Rating\n\n\n\n\nJayden Daniels\n99.4\n\n\nBo Nix\n87.9\n\n\nCaleb Williams\n87.8\n\n\n\nBy: Josh Rodriguez | Source: Pro Football Reference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this category, Daniels again leads by a decent margin.\nBased on all of this data, it seems clear that the best two rookie quarterbacks to this point are Jayden Daniels and Bo Nix. Based on the first two charts, I think the sentiment that Daniels started out in the lead, while Nix has caught up and maybe surpassed Daniels is correct.\nAs a Broncos fan myself, I have been very happy with the improvement of Bo Nix. There is a night and day difference between his first two games and his play as of late. He was flat out bad in those first two games. However, he has been fantastic as of late, highlighted by a nearly flawless game against the Falcons.\nHowever, especially based on his lead in yards per attempt and passer rating, I would say that Jayden Daniels should have a very slight lead over Bo Nix in the offensive rookie of the year conversation. However, Bo Nix has been the better quarterback as of late. If Nix continues to play as well as he has lately, I think he should overtake Daniels as the favorite for that award.\nFinally, I want to look at why each rookie quarterback has had his success and struggles.\nQuite frankly, the Bears have screwed over Caleb Williams in his first season. He was the consensus top overall pick for a reason. However, they gave him a coach who came into the years on the hot seat in Matt Eberflus, plus a bad offensive coordinator in Shane Waldron\nThe Bears knew they were going to draft Caleb Williams with their first overall pick from the Panthers. They knew Eberflus hadn’t been a great coach in his first two years with the team. They should have fired Eberflus before the season and hired a new coach who they knew would be the best for their new quarterback. Instead, they stuck with their lame duck coach, and Williams has paid for that. They fired their head coach the year after they drafted Mitch Trubisky and Justin Field as well. Not a good strategy.\nIf Williams gets a good coach around him, I think he can be a very good quarterback. However, based on the history of the Chicago Bears, I’m worried that won’t happen.\nUnlike the Bears, the Commanders hired a new coach for their new quarterback. They had the second overall pick, so they knew they would have their pick of a quarterback after Williams. Hiring a defensive coach in Dan Quinn was interesting, but hiring Kliff Kingsbury as offensive coordinator has seemed to go very well so far.\nUnlike the Bears and Commanders, the Broncos weren’t in a great position to draft a new quartberback, as they had the 12th overall pick. However, second year head coach Sean Payton did his homework in looking at the quarterbacks that the Broncos had a realistic chance of drafting, which were JJ McCarthy, Bo Nix, and Michael Penix Jr. He decided on Nix, drafting him higher then many “experts” thought he should go.\nSo far, it seems that the Payton and Nix combo is the absolutely perfect pairing. Nix seems to work very well in Payton’s offense, and has continually gotten better as the season has gone on.\nSimply put, Nix and Daniels went in to good coaching situations, Williams did not. No matter how much talent a rookie quarterback has, he needs a good coach to help him transition to the NFL.\nIn the end, I think that the 2024 NFL quarterback draft class could be looked at as one of the best ever. Obviously, Jayden Daniels and Bo Nix have had success so far, which I think will continue. If, and this is a big if, if Caleb Williams gets the right coahces around him, I think he could end up being great.\nEven though he wasn’t featured in this article, Drake Maye has shown flashes as a rookie. However, I think he probably has the worst roster around him among the rookies. If he gets better players around him, I think he has potential to be great as well. As for JJ McCarthy and Michael Penix Jr., we will see what happens once they play.\nAs of now, Jayden Daniels and Bo Nix are the best rookie quarterbacks in the NFL."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Florida State was 13-0. They had just won the ACC Championship. An undefeated team from a power five conference had never been left out of the four-team College Football Playoff since its inception in 2014. Surely they were in?\nExcept they weren’t.\nBoth 12-1 Texas and 12-1 Alabama got in instead of the Seminoles.\nMany players opted out for Florida State, which led to a 63-3 loss to Georgia in the Orange Bowl, the largest margin of defeat in any bowl game ever.\nStill, expectations were fairly high for the Seminoles going into 2023. They were ranked 10th in the preseason AP Top 25. There was hope that transfer quarterback DJ Uiagalelei could lead Florida State to another ACC Championship and a spot in the newly expanded 12-team College Football Playoff.\nBut that isn’t happening. Not by a long shot.\nInstead of competing for a spot in the College Football Playoff, the Seminoles are in the discussion of being the worst power conference team.\nGoing into week 12, Florida State sits at a horrible 1-9 overall, and 1-7 in ACC play.\nSide note: The Seminoles schedule is set up very weird. Eight of their first nine games were against ACC opponents, and their last three are non-conference games. I have never seen something like that, outside of the wacky 2020 season.\nWhat happened to Florida State? How did they go from being on the doorstep of the College Football Playoff to being perhaps the worst power conference team in the span of just one season?\nFirst, we will look at their scoring offense and scoring defense. In the end, this is the only stat that truly matters. If you move the ball and can’t finish it off with a score, all those yards don’t matter.\nIn 2023, Florida State had the top scoring offense in the ACC, averaging 34.6 points per game. Let’s take a look at how that changed from 2023 to 2024.\nAll data for 2024 is from games played through week 11.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\naccfb &lt;- read_csv(\"data/accfb_data.csv\")\n\nppg &lt;- accfb |&gt;\n  select(School, Season, OffPPG, DefPPG)\n\nfsuppg &lt;- ppg |&gt;\n  filter (School == \"Florida State\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_line(\n    data = ppg, \n    aes(\n      x = Season, \n      y = OffPPG, \n      group = School\n    ), \n    color = \"grey\"\n  ) +\n  geom_point(\n    data = ppg, \n    aes(\n      x = Season, \n      y = OffPPG, \n      group = School\n    ), \n    color = \"grey\"\n  ) +\n  geom_line(\n    data = fsuppg, \n    aes(\n      x = Season, \n      y = OffPPG, \n      group = School\n    ), \n    color = \"#782F40\"\n  ) +\n  geom_point(\n    data = fsuppg, \n    aes(\n      x = Season, \n      y = OffPPG, \n      group = School\n    ), \n    color = \"#782F40\"\n  ) +\n  geom_text(\n    data = fsuppg |&gt; filter(Season == max(Season)),\n    aes(\n      x = Season + .15, \n      y = OffPPG + .15, \n      group = School, \n      label = School\n    )\n  ) + \n  geom_text(\n    data = fsuppg |&gt; filter(Season == min(Season)),\n    aes(\n      x = Season - .15, \n      y = OffPPG - .15, \n      group = School, \n      label = School\n    )\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    breaks=c(2023, 2024), \n    limits=c(2022.75, 2024.25)\n  )  +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"\",\n    y = \"Offensive Points Per Game\", \n    title = \"Florida State's offense plummeted from 2023 to 2024\",\n    subtitle = \"The Seminoles have the worst scoring offense by far in the ACC in 2024.\",\n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Josh Rodriguez\"\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggsave(\"image.png\")\n\n\nAs you can see, the Seminoles scoring offense didn’t just fall a little bit. It absolutely fell off a cliff. Florida State is averaging a truly horrifying 13.3 points per game. The second worst team in the ACC in scoring, Stanford, is averaging 20.4 points per game.\nIn fact, the Seminoles don’t just have the worst scoring offense in the ACC. They have the worst scoring offense in all of FBS, even worse than winless Kent State.\nThey haven’t scored 20 points in a game since their week 0 game against Georgia Tech in Ireland.\nNo matter how you slice it, it’s really bad.\nNext, we will take a look at Florida State’s scoring defense.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_line(\n    data = ppg, \n    aes(\n      x = Season, \n      y = DefPPG, \n      group = School\n    ), \n    color = \"grey\"\n  ) +\n  geom_point(\n    data = ppg, \n    aes(\n      x = Season, \n      y = DefPPG, \n      group = School\n    ), \n    color = \"grey\"\n  ) +\n  geom_line(\n    data = fsuppg, \n    aes(\n      x = Season, \n      y = DefPPG, \n      group = School\n    ), \n    color = \"#782F40\"\n  ) +\n  geom_point(\n    data = fsuppg, \n    aes(\n      x = Season, \n      y = DefPPG, \n      group = School\n    ), \n    color = \"#782F40\"\n  ) +\n  geom_text(\n    data = fsuppg |&gt; filter(Season == max(Season)),\n    aes(\n      x = Season + .15, \n      y = DefPPG + .15, \n      group = School, \n      label = School\n    )\n  ) + \n  geom_text(\n    data = fsuppg |&gt; filter(Season == min(Season)),\n    aes(\n      x = Season - .15, \n      y = DefPPG - .15, \n      group = School, \n      label = School\n    )\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    breaks=c(2023, 2024), \n    limits=c(2022.75, 2024.25)\n  )  +\n  scale_y_reverse()+\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"\",\n    y = \"Opponent Points Per Game\", \n    title = \"Florida State's scoring defense faltered from 2023 to 2024 among ACC teams\",\n    subtitle = \"A smaller dropoff than the offense, but a signigicant one nonetheless.\",\n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Josh Rodriguez\"\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 12, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 11),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Seminoles scoring defense also fell way off. In 2023, they gave up just 19.3 points per game, which was second in the ACC. If you take out the Orange Bowl, where they gave up 63 points after much of their team opted out, they gave up just 15.9 points per game, best in the ACC.\nIn 2024, Florida State is giving up 29.8 points per game, which is fourth worst in the newly expanded 17-team ACC.\nWhile this is certainly a big drop-off, it isn’t as big as their offensive scoring drop-off. In fact, you could make the argument that their defense is being put in a bad position by their inept offense. Based on this, it seems that their offense is more to blame for their collapse, though the defense is also at fault.\nStill, let’s look at more data of their collapse.\nWhile scoring is the most important stat, yards are still a good indicator of a team’s success.\nLet’s take a look at where the Seminoles were in yards per game from 2023 to 2024 among ACC teams.\n\n\nCode\nfirstypg &lt;-

Source: Sports Reference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, Florida State was in the top-half of the ACC in both yards per game and opponents yards per game. In 2024, the offense, unsurprisingly, is dead last, while their defense is also near the bottom.\nAgain, this points towards both sides of the ball being to blame for their collapse. However, just like with scoring, it seems that their offense is more to blame than their defense.\nThe following is another way to see their collapse in terms of yards. The vertical line is the average yards per game for each ACC team and the horizontal line is the average yards each ACC team gives up. Each dot represents an ACC team, with the size of the dot being determined by their number of wins.\n\n\nCode\nfirstbubble &lt;- accfb |&gt;\n  select(School, Season, OffTotalYds, DefTotYds, Wins) |&gt;\n  filter (Season == \"2023\")\n\nfsufirstbubble &lt;- firstbubble|&gt;\n  filter (School == \"Florida State\")\n\nsecondbubble &lt;- accfb |&gt;\n  select(School, Season, OffTotalYds, DefTotYds, Wins) |&gt;\n  filter (Season == \"2024\")\n\n\nfsusecondbubble &lt;- secondbubble|&gt;\n  filter (School == \"Florida State\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(\n    data = firstbubble,\n    aes(\n      x = OffTotalYds, \n      y = DefTotYds, \n      size = Wins),\n    color = \"grey\"\n  ) +\n  geom_point(\n    data = fsufirstbubble,\n    aes(x = OffTotalYds, y = DefTotYds, size = Wins),\n    color = \"#782F40\"\n  ) + \n  geom_text_repel(\n    data = fsufirstbubble, \n    aes(\n      x = OffTotalYds, \n      y = DefTotYds, \n      label = School\n    )\n  ) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 385.39) + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 358.91) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=460, y=300, label=\"Moves the ball and\\nstops their opponent\"), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=350, y=425, label=\"Can't move the ball and\\n can't stop opponent\"), color=\"blue\") +\n  scale_size(range = c(3, 8), breaks= c(5, 9, 13), name = \"Wins\") +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Yards Per Game\",\n    y = \"Opponent Yards Per Game\",\n    title = \"Florida State rode both sides of the ball in 2023... \",\n    subtitle = \"The Seminoles were above average in yards per game and opponents yards per game among ACC teams.\",\n    caption = \"Source: SportsRefernce | By Josh Rodriguez\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 9), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(\n    data = secondbubble,\n    aes(\n      x = OffTotalYds, \n      y = DefTotYds, \n      size = Wins),\n    color = \"grey\"\n  ) +\n  geom_point(\n    data = fsusecondbubble,\n    aes(x = OffTotalYds, y = DefTotYds, size = Wins),\n    color = \"#782F40\"\n  ) + \n  geom_text_repel(\n    data = fsusecondbubble, \n    aes(\n      x = OffTotalYds, \n      y = DefTotYds, \n      label = School\n    )\n  ) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 402.46) + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 365.53) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=500, y=325, label=\"Moves the ball and\\nstops their opponent\"), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=300, y=425, label=\"Can't move the ball and\\n can't stop opponent\"), color=\"blue\") +\n  scale_size(range = c(3, 8), breaks= c(1, 5, 9), name = \"Wins\") +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Yards Per Game\",\n    y = \"Opponent Yards Per Game\",\n    title = \"...but are crashing in 2024\",\n    subtitle = \"The Seminoles are well below average in yards per game and opponent yards per game among ACC teams.\",\n    caption = \"Source: SportsRefernce | By Josh Rodriguez\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 9), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, Florida State went from above average to well below average in terms of yards per game and opponent yards per game from 2023 to 2024. However, the offense is in a much worse spot than the defense, despite both being in bad shape.\nSeeing that their offense is more to blame than their defense, let’s compare where the Seminoles were in terms of passing yards per game among ACC teams from 2023 to 2024\n\n\nCode\nfirstpass &lt;- accfb |&gt;\n  select(School, Season, OffPassYds) |&gt;\n  filter (Season == \"2023\")\n\nfsufirstpass &lt;-firstpass |&gt;\n  filter (School == \"Florida State\")\n\nsecondpass &lt;- accfb |&gt;\n  select(School, Season, OffPassYds) |&gt;\n  filter (Season == \"2024\")\n\nfsusecondpass &lt;-secondpass |&gt;\n  filter (School == \"Florida State\")\n\nfirstrush &lt;- accfb |&gt;\n  select(School, Season, OffRushYds) |&gt;\n  filter (Season == \"2023\")\n\nfsufirstrush &lt;-firstrush |&gt;\n  filter (School == \"Florida State\")\n\nsecondrush &lt;- accfb |&gt;\n  select(School, Season, OffRushYds) |&gt;\n  filter (Season == \"2024\")\n\nfsusecondrush &lt;-secondrush |&gt;\n  filter (School == \"Florida State\")\n\npassbar1 &lt;- ggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=firstpass, aes(x=reorder(School, OffPassYds), weight=OffPassYds), fill = \"lightgrey\") + \n  geom_bar(data=fsufirstpass, aes(x=reorder(School, OffPassYds), weight=OffPassYds), fill=\"#782F40\")+ \n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Florida State let the ball fly in 2023...\",\n    subtitle = \"Jordan Travis was a top tier quarterback.\",\n    x = \"School\", \n    y = \"Pass Yards Per Game\"\n  ) +                          \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 8, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 6), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\npassbar2 &lt;- ggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=secondpass, aes(x=reorder(School, OffPassYds), weight=OffPassYds), fill = \"lightgrey\") + \n  geom_bar(data=fsusecondpass, aes(x=reorder(School, OffPassYds), weight=OffPassYds), fill=\"#782F40\")+ \n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"...but is stuck on the runway in 2024\",\n    subtitle = \"No quarterback is having much success.\",\n    x = \"School\", \n    y = \"Pass Yards Per Game\"\n  ) +                          \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 8, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 6), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\npassbar1+passbar2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, Florida State passed the ball very well in 2023. Jordan Travis was one of the best quarterbacks in the nation in 2023 before he got hurt.\nIn 2024, the Seminoles are second worst in the ACC, ahead of only Stanford. DJ Uiagalelei was very disappointing, and his replacement, Brock Glenn, isn’t doing any better.\nNow let’s see where they went in terms of rush yards per game from 2023 to 2024 among ACC teams.\n\n\nCode\nrushbar1 &lt;- ggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=firstrush, aes(x=reorder(School, OffRushYds), weight=OffRushYds), fill = \"lightgrey\") + \n  geom_bar(data=fsufirstrush, aes(x=reorder(School, OffRushYds), weight=OffRushYds), fill = \"#782F40\")+ \n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Florida State struggled to run in 2023...\",\n    subtitle = \"They relied mostly on the pass game.\",\n    x = \"School\", \n    y = \"Rush Yards Per Game\"\n  ) +                          \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 8, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 6), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\nrushbar2 &lt;- ggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=secondrush, aes(x=reorder(School, OffRushYds), weight=OffRushYds), fill = \"lightgrey\") + \n  geom_bar(data=fsusecondrush, aes(x=reorder(School, OffRushYds), weight=OffRushYds), fill = \"#782F40\")+ \n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"...but is much worse in 2024\",\n    subtitle = \"The Seminoles can't run and can't pass.\",\n    x = \"School\", \n    y = \"Rush Yards Per Game\"\n  ) +                          \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 8, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 6), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\nrushbar1+rushbar2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, Florida State was in the bottom of the ACC in terms of rush yards per game in 2023, averaging 150.2 rush yards per game. They relied on their strong passing game to almost get to the playoff. In 2024, they are much, much worse. They are dead last in the ACC with just 80.5 rush yards per game.\nBased on those charts, we can see that, even though the Seminole’s rushing attack got worse in 2024, they didn’t rely on it for their offensive success in 2023. They did rely on the passing game, which has gone from top to bottom.\nSo what has caused Florida State’s plummet from 2023 to 2024. Well, to be honest, it’s basically everything. Everything has gotten worse. You don’t go from almost in the playoff to arguably the worst power conference team in one season because just one or two things go wrong. That happens because almost everything has gotten worse.\nHowever, if you want to find the biggest culprit, you can point to the Seminoles’ pass offense. Yes, their rushing offense got much worse. But they weren’t relying on that when they were successful. Yes, their defense got a lot worse. In fact, they actually have the worst rush defense in the ACC. But one could argue that the offense consistently puts the defense in a bad spot, making a poor defense look even worse.\nLike I said, just because the pass defense being the biggest culprit for Florida State’s collapse doesn’t mean every other aspect of their game doesn’t also contribute to their dreadful season.\nFinally, I want to pose a question. Did being snubbed from the playoff in 2023 simply break the Florida State Football program?\nThe entire team was shocked and angry at being left out. Getting destroyed in the Orange Bowl also left a stain on the program.\nOne has to wonder if the psyche of the coaching staff and returning players was destroyed from the snub. They must have felt like they did everything right and weren’t rewarded for it. Would they have collapsed so hard if they did make the playoff, even if they lost badly in that game?\nPersonally, I think that has a part to do with it. But again, there isn’t just one thing that has contributed to their historic season-to-season collapse. Everything has gone wrong for Florida State in 2024."
